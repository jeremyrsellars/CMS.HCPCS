# com.softekpanther.cms HCPCS Schedule B converter

A Clojure library designed to read the HCPCS codes from the CMS.gov Schedule B Excel workbooks and convert

## Usage

    lein run CSV  "January 2020 Addendum B CORRECTION.02042020.xlsx"
    lein run JSON "January 2020 Addendum B CORRECTION.02042020.xlsx"
    lein run SQL  "January 2020 Addendum B CORRECTION.02042020.xlsx"
